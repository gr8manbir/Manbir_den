Kp: 
1. This is the proportional part which actually controls car trajectory towards center line.
2. I observed that it is best to keep it low because the curves on the road are gradual and we don't want to have a sudden sharp turn.
Ki: 
1. Keeping this zero seemed sufficient. In a real car there might be a bias but in the video car tires seemed aligned fully.
2. Since solution worked at zero, it was never changed.
Kd:
1. Again done through hit and trial.
2. Probably curves changes suddenly and as we don't want the car to go over the red and white areas of the car curve,
   keeping this high seemed necessary to reduce the impact of Kp.
