# **Classifying images in a German traffic sign data set** 

Overview
---

Human beings are great at classifying images. Also we are very accurate at determining what an image corresponds to. This is not easy to do so 
in computers. This project seeks to implement a Convolutional Neural Network using TensorFlow to classify images in a German Traffic Sign data set.

This data set contains about 50000 images of various road signs in about 43 different categories.

A description of the data set can be found at the following location:

The images for this project were taken from

The CNN used for this project was an adaptation of LeNet architecture developed by Yan LeCunn.
